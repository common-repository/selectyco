The selectyco button can be placed anywhere you want to sell an individual content piece, e.g. article, blog post, video, audio file, epaper etc. on your website. The plugin does not interfere with any already existing paywall or subscription plugin on your site, it serves as an additional feature to also give the user the option of purchasing single content.

The plugin is simple and easy to implement – just follow the step by step instructions on the 'settings' page. After the selectyco plugin is in place you can start setting up the items available for purchase, then users can instantly start purchasing single content on your website via the selectyco button.

= Payment & Pricing =
You determine the price of your content. Each suggested sales price is adopted accordingly by the selectyco system and displayed as sales price to the user. New users receive free credit to test the selectyco service, after the free credit has been exhausted, selectyco users can easily recharge their credit by paying in advance through Paypal, credit card or bank transfer. Anytime single content is purchased via the selectyco button you receive a revenue share.

Part of the selectyco service is that you do not have to bother yourself with the payment aspect, because selectyco handles the following:

*	Prepaid-payment of the user
*	Billing to the end consumer
*	Accounting (credit note) to the publisher
*	Storage of purchased articles (links only)
*	Portfolio assignment of the articles
*	Collection
